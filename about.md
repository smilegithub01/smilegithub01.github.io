## About

I live by myself, I pay my own rent, I wear socks that match and I love my mom. I am a confident, attractive & comedic person.

I do stunt work. Have you ever seen it in a movie when a hot actor has to reveal his naked ass? Thatâ€™s my job. Oh, and Iâ€™m in the fitness biz, as well as back in school finishing up my pre-med reqs.

Food: I love food. Period.

Movies: Gladiator, Fight Club, Braveheart, Anchorman!

Six Things I Would Never do Without:

â€¢ Laughter/ comedy
â€¢ Exercise
â€¢ Friends
â€¢ Food
â€¢ Thatâ€™s none of your business ðŸ˜‰
